## STEP 1: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yesterday's closing stock price.
# close_difference = (float(second_day_close) - float(first_day_close)) * -1
# price_change = 5/100 * float(first_day_close)

# if close_difference >= price_change or close_difference <= -price_change:
#     print("Get News")

## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator
news_response = requests.get(url=NEWS_ENDPOINT, params=news_parameters)
news_response.raise_for_status()
news_data = news_response.json()
pprint.pprint(news_data)
news_title = news_data["articles"][0:3]
pprint.pprint(news_title)
## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
#HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.



#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
